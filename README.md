# Emotion
----

This is my final project for Drawing on the Web, which is about emotions

+You can choose from four emotions: excited, stressed, relaxed, and grieved, which reference [multi-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion) analysis of emotions

+When you click on one of the emotions, 1 of 3 random "experiences" occur; these experiences will be either a video, a song, or an interactive activity

+To achieve this I'll be using jQuery and CSS transitions/animations
