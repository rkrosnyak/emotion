# Emotion
-----

This is my final project for Drawing on the Web, which is about emotions

-You can choose from four emotions: excited, stressed, relaxed, and grieved, which references the [multi-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion) analysis of emotions

-When you click on one of the emotions, 1 of 3 random "experiences" occur; these experiences are 1) a video 2) an interactive song activiy or 3) an animation that represents that emotion; this is meant to mirror the essence of that emotion (e.g., excited has jumpy animation, a colorful video, and pop songs as its "experiences"

-To achieve this I'll be using jQuery to preload all of the content onto the page, JS to randomly choose which of the 3 experiences is chosen, and CSS transitions/animations
